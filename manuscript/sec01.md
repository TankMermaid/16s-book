# Foreword

## Where this document came from

I wrote an early form of this document as a teaching aid for a workshop on 16S data processing that I gave for my research group, the Alm Lab at MIT. I eventually put this document up for the larger world because it was starting to be shared in wider circles.

## What this document is for

My goal for this document is to help you understand the theory behind 16S data processing. I want you to be able to do the analysis that makes the most sense for you. I don't think it's wise to shove every dataset through the same pipeline. There are pipelines that make data analysis easy and simple. I'm going to show you how the sausage is made. It's ugly. The nice pipelines also use an ugly, complicated process somewhere inside; they just don't advertise that ugliness. I want to empower you to be able to critique and doubt other people's methods. That's part of how science advances!

## Who this document is for

This document should be a fun read for advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs who are interested in getting down and dirty with 16S data. If you know too much, I expect this document will annoy you, because you will recognize its shortcomings.

## What this document is not

This document is not perfect. It is full of my own igorance, ideas, and opinions. Take it with a grain of salt. If you find errors, blame me and not my adviser or the other members of my lab. And do point them out to me!

This document is also not intended to be a literature review. 16S data processing is an enormous field, and here I do less than scratch the surface of that field. Some specific methods are included and they show my biases toward my own lab's work.
