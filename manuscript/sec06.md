# Second opinions

I don't know of another resource designed to fill the same purpose
as this document. That's part of why I wrote it. That being
said, there are other places you can go to get something similar
(and/or meaningfully different) from what I've spouted here.

## `usearch` documentation

The [documentation](http://www.drive5.com/usearch/manual/) for `usearch`
is extensive and fascinating. The documentation for an indivudal
`usearch` function is often linked to a separate page explaining
the theory behind that step. I learned a lot from reading that
documentation.

## Pipeline tutorials

Maybe you read this hoping to get a step-by-step about how to
actually process data. The QIIME and mothur website both have
a lot of documentation about how to use their tools. They are good
places to go for step-by-step instructions.
